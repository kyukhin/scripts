1. Check out dejagnu.
2. Copy .dejagnurc to your home directory.
3. Edit .dejagnurc in your home directory with
     a. Correct path for SDE directory.
     b. Correct path for SDE emulator dejagnu directory which contains
        sde-sim and sde-sim.exp.
4. To run gcc tests under SDE emulator:
     a. "make check-gcc".  Run C tests.  There may be extra failures
        due to "-mavx" passed to gcc.
     b. "make check-c++".  Run C++ tests.
     c. "make check-fortran".  Run Fortran tests.
     d. "make libgcc".  Run C library tests.
     e. "make libc++".  Run C++ library tests.
     f. "make libfortran".  Run Fortran library tests.
     g. "make libgomp".  Run GOMP library tests.
     h. "make libmudflap".  Run modflap library tests.
     i. "make libs".  Run GOMP and modflap library tests.
     j. "make c".  Run C and C/GOMP/modflap library tests.
     k. "make c++".  Run C++ and C++ library tests.
     l. "make fortran".  Run Fortran and Fortran library tests.
     m. "make check".  Run all C, C++ and Fortran tests.
  You can use "make -jN" to start parallel check.  N can be the number
  of processors.
